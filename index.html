				<p>Dr. Andy Castillo is the owner and Medical Director of <a href="http://www.mdlaserstudio.com">M.D. Laser Studio</a>. He is a family physician with extensive dermatological and surgical training. His education includes a B.S. degree in Zoology from the University of Maryland, an M.D. degree from Wake Forest University, and a Masters in Business from Duke University. Dr. Castillo completed an internship in general surgery at Walter Reed Army Medical Center while serving in the United States Army as a flight surgeon and in various other capacities. During that time he also successfully completed a plastic and reconstructive surgery research fellowship at prestigious Johns Hopkins. Following his military service, he finished a three-year residency in family medicine and established a successful private practice in Mooresville, NC. Dr. Castillo opened M.D. Laser Studio in 2001 as an adjunct to his family practice, but he quickly grew the business and helped it evolve to a singular entity.</p>
				<p>A Fellow of the American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery, Dr. Castillo has participated in the Constitution &amp; Bylaws Committee, Audit Committee, and Strategic Planning Committee. With his extensive expertise on such a wide variety of equipment, he is often called upon to train others in laser procedures. He has served as a Luminary for Laserscope/Iridex, is a Gold-Level Provider of Botox for Allergan, and has trained and spoken on behalf of Medicis, the provider of Restylane, Perlane, and Dysport.</p>
				<p>Dr. Castillo and his wife, Dr. Rebecca Appleton, are raising six children in the Lake Norman area, approximately 30 miles north of Charlotte, NC. In addition to M.D. Laser Studio, he and his wife own three <a href="http://www.passporthealthnc.com">Passport Health</a> locations, where he also serves as Medical Director.</p>

				<p style="float:right;"><img src="images/john.jpg" /></p>
				<p>John joined M.D. Laser Studio in 2006 providing technical support on location. Very soon he was helping manage our website, eventually taking over hosting and web administration in addition to managing all computer hardware and software. At a very early age, John discovered his passion for technology and has been on a path to a career in that industry ever since. John was one of the early participants in the Collaborative College for Technology and Leadership, a five-year early college high school program. He began working with MDLS as a freshman, and the following year started teaching video production classes to gifted students at Iredell-Statesville Schools summer camps. Within a few years, he was offering computer services through <a href="http://www.johnmairs.com">JMTech</a> and added Passport Health to his list of employers. Now attending the University of North Carolina at Asheville, John still manages to juggle his work responsibilities despite being a full-time student studying a mix of computer science and new media.</p>
